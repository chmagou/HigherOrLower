# HigherOrLower

An Android app, written in Java. It is made for the Udemy course, The Complete Android N Developer Course by Rob Percival. The goal is to make a game, where you have to guess the random that is chosen in the range of (1, 20).

## What I learned

* Developed a UI within the activity_main.xml using RelativeLayout, TextView, EditText and Button.
* Implemented functionality to the UI using: onCreate and guessPressed (onClick).
* Used the Toast message to return the result of the guessed number from the user. Depending on his answer, it gets the suitable response with a Toast message.
